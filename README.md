# Micro Compiler
**A very tiny compiler just-for-fun made for language called Micro and it translates it into 3 address code called Tiny.**

_This project could be used as a start point for those who wants to learn more about compilers_

### Tools Used:
[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) is used for generating the code of Scanner and Parser parts of the project, the rest of code is handcrafted by me.
For more help about ANTLR [see their docs](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md)
